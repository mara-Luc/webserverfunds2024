        <p>This site is a submission for a class that I am taking at Dawson college where I am learning the fundamentals of creating Web servers. 
        The goal is to eventually create a site that will be used in conjunction with a project that I will build. 
        I am not sure yet what I will build for my project yet but as things developed so will this site.</p>
